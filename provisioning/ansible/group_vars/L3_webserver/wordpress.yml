  - title: Automation technology
    author: jonesk
    category: Digitalization
    date: "2022-10-11 12:41:13"
    content: |
      <em>Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are being used in a variety of ways in
      production processes and in the development of autonomous machines and
      vehicles. At Berlin Science Week on November 7, AIT is hosting the
      high-profile event "AI-enabled Automation", which will discuss how
      intelligent machines can support humans and help solve major problems of the
      future, such as resource conservation, climate protection or labor
      shortages.</em><br><br>
      Machines that perform an activity automatically have fascinated mankind since
      time immemorial. Even more so when their activities work intelligently - such as
      the so-called "Schachtuerke", for example, which enthralled the Viennese court
      in the spring of 1770. At that time, the Austro-Hungarian court official and
      mechanic Wolfgang von Kempelen showed "Empress" Maria Theresa his latest work:
      a chess table at which sat a human-like, Turkish-robed figure that could move
      chess pieces with a mechanical arm - and also win against most opponents. For a
      long time, people puzzled over how the machine, which had clearly audible gears
      at work inside, managed to do this. The inventor kept silent all his life about
      the fact that it was simply a deception, a fraud: Hidden inside the apparatus
      was a human chess player who operated the mechanism. As technology advanced,
      however, it became more and more plausible that machines could actually achieve
      such capabilities. Thus, hardly anyone was surprised anymore when, in 1996,
      IBM"s "Deep Blue" computer was able to beat a reigning world chess champion for
      the first time. In the intervening two centuries, humanity had witnessed the
      rise of technology and had become accustomed to the idea that machines could
      take over many a task previously reserved for humans, and could even do some
      things better. Calculating machines, for example, that tirelessly add up numbers
      without error. Or, later, industrial robots that assemble parts or process
      surfaces with a speed and/or precision unattainable by humans.<br><br>
      <h2>Robot arms working at an assembly line</h2>
      Autonomously operating machines must master a great many skills. This includes,
      for example, the control of hydraulic components and the mechanical system,
      reliable task and motion planning including localization of the machine"s own
      position - even in changing environments - correct gripping of objects, robust
      perception of the environment, and object classification for correct
      interpretation of the environment. AI systems help significantly with these
      complex tasks.<br><br>
      <h2>Robots are already on the move in the field</h2>
      Whether such devices can be called "intelligent" is a matter of considerable
      debate. Today, at any rate, there are machines that can actually perform tasks
      autonomously and largely independently of humans. One example comes from an area
      that at first glance one would not consider all that innovative: In agriculture,
      autonomous working machines are already in use that - controlled by GPS and
      sensors - automatically pull their furrows in fields. Small, four-wheeled robots
      that work together as a fleet of autonomous special machines are also already
      ready for series production. These vehicles sow seeds, note where a crop is
      located, detect weeds with sensors (and analyze the data using AI methods) and
      kill unwanted plants with high-voltage pulses. Precision farming" is possible
      with such systems: Every field, every plant, receives exactly the treatment it
      needs - from irrigation and fertilization to pest control. Such farm robots
      still have their price, and many questions remain unanswered, for example about
      the use of the collected data. But they are predicted to have a bright future,
      not least because it is becoming increasingly difficult to find harvest workers
      and qualified personnel to work in the fields.<br><br>

  - title: Quantum technology based on Nobel Prize-worthy knowledge
    author: jonesk
    category: Digitalization

    content: |
      <em>In his fundamental research, which has now been awarded the world"s highest
      science prize, physics Nobel laureate Anton Zeilinger laid the foundation for
      the development of quantum communication technologies at the AIT Austrian
      Institute of Technology. The goal is to make this extremely secure technology
      suitable for everyday use and to establish a quantum communication network
      throughout Europe.</em><br><br>
      Every transmission of data offers a gateway for cyber criminals: eavesdropping
      and hacker attacks are now commonplace and cause gigantic damage. One of the
      most important measures to ensure security is the encryption of data. The
      dominant encryption method today, so-called "symmetric" encryption, is indeed de
      facto indecipherable (at least as long as the keys are sufficiently complex).
      However, there is a catch: in order to be able to use this method when
      transmitting data, the key itself must be transmitted in an absolutely secure
      way. Traditionally, this has been done by handing over the key in person or by
      letter. However, this is hardly feasible for worldwide communication.<br><br>
      <h2>Safety through natural laws</h2>
      Quantum physics comes to the rescue: There is a phenomenon called "entanglement
      of particles": Two entangled particles have exactly the same properties, even if
      they are very far apart. If you change the properties of one of the two
      particles, this has an immediate effect on the other particle. This means, on
      the one hand, that confidential information can be exchanged in this way, and on
      the other hand, that one immediately notices if someone is listening in on this
      communication (because reading out information also changes the state of the
      particles). <br><br>Albert Einstein once dismissed this phenomenon as
      "spooky action at a distance". But in 1997, the Viennese quantum physicist Anton
      Zeilinger (University of Vienna, Austrian Academy of Sciences) was able to
      demonstrate that this principle can indeed be used in the form of so-called
      "teleportation" - the transport of the state of a light particle. In 1999, he
      succeeded in proving that the phenomenon also works for the transmission of
      confidential information. For this work on quantum-physical entanglement,
      Zeilinger has now been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics - together with
      his colleagues John Clauser and Alain Aspect. <br><br>A real proof of
      practical applicability was provided in 2004 - namely by transmitting a
      symmetric key by means of entangled photons (light particles) over a 600-meter
      fiber optic line between a Viennese bank and the city hall. Since then, this has
      also been achieved in fiber-optic networks hundreds of kilometers long, between
      two Canary Islands, and most recently via a satellite between Beijing and
      Vienna. In technical jargon, this is called quantum key distribution (QKD).<br><br>
      <h2>Technical application of scientific knowledge</h2>
      Researchers at AIT have been involved in these experiments from the very
      beginning: They develop the technical equipment for quantum cryptography and
      organize large research networks, such as the EU project SEQOQC, which involved
      41 partners from twelve countries. Over the past decade, AIT has gained an
      international reputation as a specialist in both terrestrial and satellite-based
      quantum cryptography and as a coordinator of major European projects.<br><br>Currently,
      the work is particularly focused on miniaturizing the devices needed for quantum
      communications. "We are building prototypes that have the same functionality as
      large laboratory setups but are integrated on an optical chip," explains AIT
      researcher Hannes Hübel. The goal is to create small and compact terminals that
      can be easily used by anyone with a fiber-optic connection - similar to the way
      people today keep a modem by their computer for Internet access.<br><br>
      <h2>Quantum Flagship: Towards a Quantum Industry</h2>
      For the technology to actually gain a foothold in practice, three factors play a
      key role: the robustness, size and price of the devices. "We try to reduce the
      technological complexity as much as possible, use standard components and make
      the whole thing robust, i.e. stable over the long term," says Hübel. This also
      requires developing lots of electronics and control software. This work is
      taking place, among other things, as part of the major European Quantum Flagship
      program, which was launched in 2018 with a time frame of ten years and a funding
      volume of one billion euros. <br><br>Of four flagship projects in the field
      of quantum communication, AIT is leading one project and is a partner in
      another. The Viennese researchers are leading the UNIQORN project (Affordable
      Quantum Communication for Everyone: Revolutionizing the Quantum Ecosystem from
      Fabrication to Application). Together with 17 partners from Europe, photonic
      technologies are being used to advance the miniaturization of quantum
      applications in the direction of system-on-chip solutions. The "CiViQ"
      (Continuous Variable Quantum Communications) project focuses on the
      cost-effective integration of quantum communications into emerging optical
      telecommunications networks. 21 partners, including leading telecoms,
      integrators and developers of QKD, are working on flexible and cost-effective
      systems for quantum key distribution. AIT is developing QKD prototypes and
      specialized software for field deployment in this project.<br><br>
      <h2>Testbeds and secure networks</h2>
      Another thrust to make quantum communication suitable for everyday use is the
      establishment of networks and testbeds in Europe. Already in September 2019, the
      EU launched the Horizon 2020 project "OPENQKD" (Open European Quantum Key
      Distribution Testbed), which is scheduled for three years and funded with 15
      million euros. The consortium, led by AIT, comprises 38 partners from 13
      countries and brings together manufacturers, network operators, system
      integrators, SMEs, research institutions, universities, certification and
      standardization bodies, and end users. With the goal of establishing a secure
      network for quantum communications in Europe and thus launching a European
      ecosystem for quantum technology providers and application developers, the
      consortium is pushing ahead with the development of various demonstrators (some
      of them in Austria) and future applications. This includes e.g. storage in cloud
      infrastructures, protection of sensitive medical information (testbed in Graz)
      or government communication data (testbed in Vienna).<br><br>

      We currently have to cope with a multitude of crisis phenomena - from global
      political tensions to the climate and energy crises to the consequences of the
      pandemic. Many of these current problem areas were discussed at the Alpbach
      Technology Symposium 2022. "If we reflect on what the experts have told us
      over the past two days, they agree in that we have a certain chance of coping
      with the challenges," summed up Wolfgang Knoll, scientific director of the AIT
      Austrian Institute of Technology. "The consensus is that to do this we need a
      deeper scientific understanding that is translated into new technologies and
      into innovations," said Knoll at the end of the talks, which have been
      organized by AIT and ORF Radio Ö1 in a tried and tested manner for more than
      30 years.
      </em>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Need for personal exchange</h2>
      The more than 20 Plenary and Content Partner Sessions, which took place from
      August 25 to 27 in the Tyrolean "Village of Thinkers", met with great interest
      from the technology community. The discussions then took place in well-filled
      rooms - almost like before the Corona crisis, which forced a virtual or hybrid
      execution in the past two years. "There is an urgent need for face-to-face
      exchange. The Alpbach Technology Symposium brings innovators together, promotes
      the exchange of ideas and stimulates dialogue between science, society and
      politics," says Knoll. <br><br>With the active participation of scientific
      partners - the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers and the
      Complexity Science Hub Vienna - a broad panorama of challenges that urgently
      need to be solved was covered in high-profile plenary sessions. For example, the
      session "Energy Transition: How to reduce Energy Dependency" discussed, among
      other things, the plans of major companies such as BASF, Infineon and
      voestalpine to increase efficiency and reduce emissions. Under the title
      "RNA-based Medicine of the Future," the heads of leading research institutes
      outlined their expectations of how new molecular biology methods could radically
      improve the treatment of cancer or autoimmune diseases. The Ukraine war was the
      focus of the session "Battleground Internet: Between Cyberwar and Infowar,"
      which clearly elaborated that today"s wars are no longer won or lost exclusively
      on the battlefield, but increasingly in the virtual world and in our minds. The
      session "Complexity of Supply Chains: Ways into a More Resilient Future"
      concluded that greater transparency is essential to make supply chains less
      prone to disruption in the future. An "International Talk" addressed the fact
      that technology is now a significant geopolitical force. In other highly
      exciting content sessions, pressing issues such as artificial intelligence,
      bioeconomy, climate-neutral mobility, fake news and data sovereignty were
      discussed in detail. <br><br>
      <h2>A "mindset" for radical change</h2>
      The importance of science, research, technology and innovation for crisis
      management was also emphasized by politicians. RTI is not an element for acute
      crisis management, said Climate Protection and Technology Minister Leonore
      Gewessler. But: "RTI is an instrument for overcoming future crises. It is good
      that we invested in renewable energy research ten years ago. Therefore, we now
      have solutions that we can roll out in mass programs." <br><br>In the "Café
      Exchange" (in Alpbach"s Altes Schulhäusl, which was occupied for the first time
      this year), artists demonstrated how to change the "mindset" for living with
      uncertainties and for radical change. The Alpbach Technology Symposium was once
      again the place where numerous innovations were presented to the public. For
      example, the future plans of "Silicon Austria Labs" were discussed and new
      funding programs for radical innovations and for data research were presented.
      In addition, numerous social events, such as the AIT Garden Party or the
      "Forschung Austria" reception, served to encourage personal discussions.
      <br><br>
      <h2>Reason for optimism</h2>
      Young people were also back in Alpbach this year: the fellows from all over the
      world participated actively in the high-level debates. The positive spirit of
      the young participants was visible not only in the lively discussions inside and
      outside the conference center, but also in the qualification for the "Falling
      Walls Lab" in Berlin (in the form of three-minute pitches) and the 24-hour
      innovation marathon, in which eight international student teams developed
      solutions for concrete problems of partner companies. "Listening to the young
      people in Alpbach, one has good reason to be optimistic about the future,"
      commented Wolfgang Knoll.

      A recent report by the Stockholm Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) details that
      we are living in a new era of complex and often unpredictable risks. Multiple
      crises overlap and reinforce each other: coronapandemic, climate change,
      biodiversity loss, energy crisis, inflation, the war in Ukraine, and many
      other geopolitical tensions are increasingly affecting the lives of more and
      more people. The multiple crises have massive economic and social impacts:
      These range from a shift in the "terms of trade" and thus prosperity in
      different regions to social tensions that can pose a serious threat to
      democracy.
      </em>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Presence meeting in the Tyrolean mountains</h2>
      Technologies offer an important key to overcoming these crisis phenomena, is the
      firm conviction of Hannes Androsch, doyen of the Alpbach Technology Talks from
      the very beginning. The traditional meeting of the technology community in
      Alpbach, curated by the AIT Austrian Institute of Technology and ORF Radio Ö1 in
      cooperation with the European Forum Alpbach, will take place this year from
      Thursday, August 25, (2 p.m.) to Saturday, August 27 (2 p.m.) - and after two
      years of virtual or hybrid implementation, this year it will once again be a
      face-to-face event. Participants can look forward to 40 hours of high-level
      debates in more than 20 plenary sessions, workshops and partner sessions, there
      will also be plenty of opportunities for networking. <br><br>The program
      will focus on solutions to the many problems we currently face. The general
      theme is "The New Europe" and follows the four thematic tracks of the European
      Forum Alpbach 2022: Securing Europe"s Future in a Globalised World, The Climate
      Opportunity, The Financing of Europe"s Future, and The Future of Democracy and
      the Rule of Law in Europe. <br><br>
      <h2>
      How our energy system is becoming more resilient, sustainable and secure
      </h2>
      The energy crisis is coming to a head more and more. Starting with the Corona
      crisis and now massively intensified by the war in Ukraine, energy security has
      become a top issue of our days. A comprehensive transformation of our energy
      system is necessary - towards a system that simultaneously ensures security of
      supply and climate protection. A panel of top international researchers and
      industry representatives - including Bernd Rech (Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin),
      Carla Seidel (BASF), Peter Schwab (voestalpine) and Sabine Herlitschka
      (Infineon) - will look for ways to completely rethink our energy system. The
      panel will discuss fundamental requirements for the future energy supply and
      ways to make our use of resources more resilient, sustainable and secure.
      <br><br>
      <h2>When global supply chains get out of sync</h2>
      The energy crisis is embedded in the turmoil in which the international supply
      chains are caught up. These lifelines of the global economy have been running
      anything but smoothly since the outbreak of the pandemic: closed ports and
      slaughterhouses, shortages of containers, lack of truck drivers, etc. mean that
      supply routes for industry, but also for the global food supply, have become
      uncertain. High-profile experts from academia and practice, including Gabriel
      Felbermayr (WIFO), Stefan Thurner (Complexity Science Hub Vienna), Charles
      Godfray (Oxford University), and Andreas Gerstenmayer (AT&S), will analyze the
      underlying common mechanisms for seemingly unrelated developments from the
      perspective of complexity research and practice. The debate will lay a solid
      foundation for conceptualizing a more resilient and climate-friendly global
      economic system and provide answers to questions such as: What pathways might
      lead to a more resilient future? Is local production desirable, and to what
      extent is global production inevitable? Can transparency in supply networks be a
      game changer? What should policymakers do? <br><br>
      <h2>RNA-based vaccines: What"s next for research?</h2>
      Just how crucial technology can be in shaping the future has recently become
      clear, particularly in biotechnology: innovative RNA-based vaccines have proved
      to be rapidly available and effective weapons in the fight against the Covid 19
      pandemic. That this technology can do much more has become clear in laboratories
      around the world in recent years: numerous areas of medicine, especially the
      treatment of cancer, but also, for example, the regeneration of damaged tissue,
      can benefit greatly from RNA-based therapeutics. In cooperation with the
      Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers, the opportunities of this
      medical field of hope will be discussed as well as the risks and hurdles - among
      others with Ormar Wiestler (Helmholtz), Helga Nowotny (Research Council), Klaus
      Cichutek (Paul Ehrlich Institute) and Christoph Huber (BioNTech). <br><br>
      <h2>Infowar and cyberwar</h2>
      Of course, technology is always a coin with two sides: Knives or automobiles are
      very useful things, but they can also be misused as lethal weapons. The same
      applies to information and communication technologies. Not least in the war in
      Ukraine, the Internet has become a war zone - an infowar and a cyberwar are
      raging: On the one hand, the real fighting on social networks is accompanied by
      videos of fighting, fleeing people and bombed buildings. In the battle for
      narratives, heroic stories line up seamlessly with disinformation. On the other
      side, hacktivists are engaged in an exchange of blows, using all digital means
      at their disposal: From the shadows of the Internet, warring hacker groups
      attempt to damage the other side and, for example, cripple infrastructures. In
      the high-profile plenary session "Battlerground Internet: Between Cyberwar and
      Infowar", leading scientists and military experts such as Markus Reisner
      (Military Academy Wr. Neustadt), Susanne Spahn (journalist) and Volker Kozok
      (German Armed Forces) will trace current developments, outline patterns in the
      cyber world and connections with the real world. <br><br>
      <h2>International Talk: Technology as a geopolitical force</h2>
      The current multiple crisis also threatens our concept of freedom, prosperity
      and security. This requires not only geopolitical efforts, but also new
      technological responses. Innovations help us to overcome the crises, but they
      are also increasingly becoming an important instrument of power politics.
      Whoever is ahead in the development of future technologies today can leave its
      mark on the world. Wedged between the power blocs of the USA and East Asia, the
      New Europe needs a powerful boost to catch up - with research & development,
      education and a spirit of innovation. <br><br>
      <h2>Integrative power of the arts</h2>
      The meeting of the technology community in Alpbach will also address the role of
      the arts in the necessary transformations that our social and economic system is
      undergoing. An interdisciplinary debate in cooperation with the University of
      Applied Arts Vienna will outline new ways to encourage people to rethink and
      act, and to creatively prepare society for future upheavals. <br><br>"New
      Europe" is facing great challenges and it is urgent that new answers are given
      from Europe. In an RTI opening talk that has become a valued tradition, top
      representatives from politics and industry will be on hand to answer questions.
